module ActiveRecord
  module AssociatedSave
    module ClassMethods
      # Creates a callback which saves associated records
      # when passed in from a form.  An example will be much easier
      # to explain this :-)
      # 
      # Example:
      #   class Collection < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_many :items
      #     associated_save :items
      #   end
      #       
      #   class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     belongs_to :collection
      #   end
      # 
      #   # some form:
      #   <% @collection.items.each do |item| %>
      #     <% fields_for 'collection[_items][]', item do |form| %>
      #       <%= form.text_field :name %>
      #       <%= form.hidden_field :id %>
      #     <% end %>
      #   <% end %>
      # 
      # When the collection is saved, the associated :items are
      # updated based on the data in params[:collection][:_items]
      # 
      # By default, the parameter key name is the association name
      # with a prefix of _, but this can be set to anything you want
      # by setting the :from option.
      # 
      # In the example, an after_save callback named "save_associated_items"
      # would be created.  When the callback is invoked, all associated 
      # objects defined will be updated, and anything not updated is deleted,
      # unless the :delete option is set to false (defaults to true).  This is
      # useful if you use JS to remove a set of form fields from the DOM, for
      # example.
      #
      # Note: this plugin is designed for has_many relationships,
      # since that is the most likely candidate for this type of functionality.
